[ocr_utils.py: lines 53-61] – Added _open_pdf helper with password prompt and error handling.
[ocr_utils.py: lines 70-75] – _is_ocr_needed now uses _open_pdf, logs failures.
[ocr_utils.py: lines 90-96] – extract_text_from_pdf uses _open_pdf to handle locked PDFs.
[ocr_utils.py: lines 117-124] – extract_text_with_ocr now uses _open_pdf.
[kyo_qa_tool_app.py: line 104] – Replaced bare except with 'except Exception'.
[kyo_qa_tool_app.py: lines 196, 260] – Split one-line if statements for readability.
[processing_engine.py: lines 1-12] – Replaced wildcard imports with explicit names.
[run.py: line 83] – Split statement to comply with style guidelines.
[run.py: line 110] – Fixed typo in global variable list.
[test_file_utils.py] – Added unit test for is_file_locked function.

[general] – python -m py_compile reported no syntax errors. All current unit tests pass.
[file_utils.py: lines 14-22] – is_file_locked may miss admin or network locks. Consider using msvcrt on Windows for exclusive open and catching PermissionError.
[processing_engine.py: line 140] – openpyxl.load_workbook can raise InvalidFileException when Excel is password protected. Wrap in try/except and notify the user.
[ocr_utils.py: lines 54-68] – _open_pdf handles passwords but not permission errors. Catch fitz.FileDataError or PermissionError and raise PDFExtractionError with clear message.
[kyo_qa_tool_app.py: lines 303-309] – open_result catches all exceptions. Add specific handling for FileNotFoundError to show "File not found" dialog.
[tests/test_file_utils.py] – Only checks unlocked file case. Add a test that locks a file and asserts is_file_locked returns True.
[misc] – Many .py files lack a trailing newline (e.g., config.py, custom_exceptions.py). Add final newline for style compliance.
[file_utils.py: lines 14-37] – Improved is_file_locked to use msvcrt on Windows and fcntl on other systems for accurate lock detection.
[processing_engine.py: lines 139-145] – Wrapped load_workbook in try/except for InvalidFileException to avoid crashes on protected files.
[ocr_utils.py: lines 54-70] – _open_pdf now handles FileDataError and PermissionError with clear PDFExtractionError messages.
[kyo_qa_tool_app.py: lines 303-311] – open_result shows a specific error when the result file is missing.
[tests/test_file_utils.py: lines 17-25] – Added test to validate locked file detection.
[misc] – Added trailing newlines to several modules for PEP 8 compliance.
